## About the Project 
In this project, an R package (BTTEST) is created. The package provides three types of t-test and plots the input data. Depending on whether the data is paired or not and depending on the tested variances in the data, a T-test, Welch, or Paired test is applied to the data. The test type and confidence interval can be printed, and appropriate boxplot(s) of data can be plotted.
