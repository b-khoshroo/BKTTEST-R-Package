## Introduction
This package provides a few tools for Student's t-test (briefly, t-test) used in
some statistical analyses. It can handle three types of t-test: "Two Sample 
t-test," "Welch," and "Pired t-test." In what follows, I want to explain
how the package works and can help us with applying an appropraite t-test
on input data. 

## The constructor method (myttest)
The "myttest" method is a constructor creating an S3 object of type Rttest.
